## Title
Analyzing Economic Indicators in the Americas: A Multi-Dataset Study

## Main Question
"How do GDP, unemployment rates, and public debt correlate with consumer price index trends in the United State?"

## Description
This project explores the relationships between key economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, public debt, and the consumer price index (CPI) in the Americas.
By analyzing multiple datasets, we aim to uncover trends and correlations that reveal the economic dynamics within the region.
Using statistical methods and visualizations, this study will evaluate how these factors interplay over time and across regions. 
The insights from this analysis could provide valuable understanding for policymakers and economic analysts interested in regional economic trends and challenges.
